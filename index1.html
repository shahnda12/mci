Graphic design refers to a number of technical and professional disciplines that focus on visual communication and its presentation.  Various methods are used to create and combine symbols, images or words to create a visual representation of ideas and messages.  A graphic designer may use techniques such as calligraphy, visual arts, and page layout to reach the end result.  This graphic design often refers to both the process (design) through which communication is created as well as products (designs).  Among the users of the art of graphic design are magazines, advertisements and packaging products.  For example, a set of products might include a logo or other artwork, structured text and some pure design elements such as shapes and colors that would mold the product into one.  Composition is one of the most important features of graphic design, especially when using pre-prepared materials or various elements.</h2></p>
